## Jessica Gertig 

Hello 👋, I'm a full stack web developer skilled in JavaScript, React, Node, HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. Passionate about creating useful, attractive, and intuitive front end user interfaces. As a full stack developer, I'm invested in owning a feature or product from end to end and I find joy in creating delightful user interfaces, and great satisfaction in building a backend which serves the frontend both efficiently and effectively. I get energized through harnessing both creativity and analytical thinking to find solutions to complex problems.

When not coding, I am training my rambunctious German Shepherd 🐕 or looking for the best sources for images and information on historical clothing 👗
